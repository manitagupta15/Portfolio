          A gamified health accountability mobile app.<br /><br />
          Well, most people have difficulty eating the correct amount of food
          and being too sedentary in day to day life. As such our mission is to
          try and promote healthy eating and physical movement by creating a
          sense of friendly competition and accountability amongst a group of
          friends. It is aimed at anyone looking for a fun way to stay
          healthy.<br /><br />
          To achieve this we have implemented the following features:
          <b>Calorie tracking</b> using a <b>barcode scanner</b>, custom food
          inputs or database searching. Live <b>pedometer tracking</b> to
          monitor daily steps. A chatroom where users can help motivate each
          other and keep friends accountable to their goals. A live updating
          leaderboard showing who is closest to achieving their goals for that
          day. <br /><br />
          Built on <b>React Native Expo</b> for frontend using <b>HTML</b> and
          styled using <b>CSS</b> and uses ‘axios’ to make the HTTP calls. To
          keep track of steps and calorie counts, it has an integrated barcode
          scanner and pedometer which uses <b>Expo Sensors</b>.
          <b>React Navigation</b> was used to seamlessly transition from one app
          screen to the next and to create a very intuitive and user-friendly
          tab navigation bar. <b>React Native Gifted Chat</b> was used in
          conjunction with Firebase to create a very familiar instant messaging
          style chatroom. Used <b>Trello Board</b> for task & issue tracking.<br /><br /><b
            >Firebase Authentication</b
          >
          was used on the login and registration pages to create a secure
          environment to store user data. <b>Cloud Firestore</b> was used as our
          main backend database to keep track of live data. External API -
          <b>Open Food Facts</b> was used to process barcode requests.
          <b>Calorie Ninjas API</b>
          was also used to fetch calorie data.

          A true classic Game. In this, Users can click on squares to place an
          alternating X or O. If a user places 3 X or O's horizontally,
          vertically or diagonally then the game let's them know that they've
          won! Keep track of whose turn it is. Players can only choose squares
          that haven't already been taken. Once a player has won allow them to
          reset the game. Keep track of the players scores. Alternate who goes
          first. <br /><br />

          This Project demonstrate <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> skills by building
          a site about a place called Sri Ganganagar in the state of Rajasthan,
          India. It is functional at different screen sizes and employ good
          practises for those using alternative means to access the website,
          i.e. screen readers. Uses flexbox layout model that specify sizes and
          positions with CSS. Also uses media queries that allows to specify
          particular styling to be applied at specific ranges of screen sizes,
          giving extra control over where we position things and how we size
          elements and typefaces on different sized devices. Use of relative
          units when we specify sizes and positions with CSS. <br /><br />
