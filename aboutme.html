          <p class="about-me-heading">I am Manita and I love to explore!</p>
          I am a Software Developer with experience in full stack web
          development. I had worked as software developer at Infosys before
          taking a carrier break. I am mum of 2 wonderful boys and I have
          enjoyed spending my time bringing them up. Now, they are in school and
          more independent, I decided to return to work. To test and prove my
          own flexibility I volunteered at schools and taught kids "Abacus",
          mental Maths. I also worked at a nursery as a childcare practioner. It
          is when I heard about Northcoders from a friend and enrolled with them
          to re-skill myself with the latest technologies. Northcoders Bootcamp
          has rekindled my love for programming while giving me the confidence
          to get back into coding and design. During the course of this program,
          I have the oppurtunity to do pair-programming and work with different
          individuals,which has given me an ability to express my ideas and
          logic clearly as a navigator. It has also given me an understanding of
          the other person's views and asked for clarification while driving.
