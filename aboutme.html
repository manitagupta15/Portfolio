          I am Manita and I love to explore!<br /><br />
          I am a driven Software Developer with an eye for detail. As a mum of 2
          beautiful children, I have enjoyed spending my time bringing them up
          thouroughly so far. Now, they are in school and more independent, I
          decided I need new challenges. To test and prove my own flexibility I
          volunteered at schools and taught kids "Abacus", mental Maths. I also
          worked at a nursery as a childcare practioner. It is when I heard
          about Northcoders and enrolled with them to reskill myself. I never
          realised how my computer science engineering background lay latent to
          be explored. Northcoders Bootcamp has rekindled my love for
          programming while giving me the confidence to get back into coding and
          design. During the course of this program, I have the oppurtunity to
          do pair-programming and work with different individuals,which has
          given me an ability to express my ideas and logic clearly as a
          navigator. It has also given me an understanding of the other person's
          views and asked for clarification while driving. <br /><br />I have
          learnt the value of patience and diplomatic communication after
          becoming a parent. <br />Living in different parts of the world has
          given me an opportunity to experience new cultures and interact with
          people from all over the world. <br /><br />Since I was a teenager, I
          have enjoyed cooking and baking. Living in different places has given
          me the opportunity to experience different local flavours and cusines.
          This in-turn drives me to experiment with new flavour profiles.
